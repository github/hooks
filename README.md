![hooks](docs/assets/hooks.png)

## Installation ðŸ’Ž

You can download this Gem from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/github/hooks/pkgs/rubygems/hooks-ruby) or [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/hooks-ruby)

Via a Gemfile:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "hooks-ruby", "~> X.X.X" # Replace X.X.X with the latest version
```

## Usage ðŸ’»

### Basic

```ruby
# file: config.ru
require "hooks-ruby"

config = {
  use_catchall_route: true # will use the DefaultHandler for /webhooks/* - just an example/demo
}

app = Hooks.build(config: config)
run app
```

Run the hooks server:

```bash
bundle exec puma --tag hooks
```

Send a webhook request to the server:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://0.0.0.0:9292/webhooks/hello \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{}'

# => { "message": "webhook processed successfully", "handler": "DefaultHandler", "timestamp": "2025-06-10T23:15:07-07:00" }
```

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a basic Hooks server which will listen to anything under `/webhooks/*` and respond with a success message.
